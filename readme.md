# Jordan Uses mediastack

This package has some sample code using [mediastack](https://mediastack.com/). Mediastack is an API that is extremely easy to use for accessing live news and blog data. It has specific keyword, country, language, and category search.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

You'll need to get an API key (from [mediastack](https://mediastack.com/)) and rename `.sample.env` file to `.env` and place your api key there.

There are different functions that are well documented within `src/index.ts`.

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
